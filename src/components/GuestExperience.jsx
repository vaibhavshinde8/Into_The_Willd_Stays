            Into The Wilds Stays was the perfect escape from city life. The views of the majestic Himalayas right from our room were breathtaking. The staff was incredibly warm and attentive, making us feel at home. We loved the bonfire under the starlit sky, surrounded by the sounds of nature. If youâ€™re looking for tranquility and an authentic Himalayan experience, this place is a must-visit!
